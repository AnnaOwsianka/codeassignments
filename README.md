# Codeassignments
Small code assignment for interview candidates

## Instruction
Create a branch of this, do your changes and issue a Pull Request. 
Please focus on the TODOs and the hints available in the source code. 
READ!

## What to do? 
There is an implementation and a test class with TODOs that hint on what to do. 
The tasks are supposed to be in increasing complexity, so start from the top and work downwards. 

Spend a max of 3 hours on this, it is OK to come up with something less than perfect. Whatever you
learn from this we will use for a discussion.
